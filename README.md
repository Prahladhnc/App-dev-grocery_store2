This code is compiled in a single "app.py" flask app. All the HTML files are stored in the "templates" folder, and "groceries.sqlite3" is the database.
When you run the app.py, it establishes a localhost and gives the link in the output terminal. Click on the link, or enter the link in a browser.
This leads to the HOME page. It has options to Login as Admin, Sign Up as Admin, Login as User and Sign In as user. 

Create your account or login as an admin. Admin has access to view all previously added categories and products. They can also add, create or delete categories or products and their values.

After logging in as user, users can see the list of all available products with details. They can add the products to cart and choose the quantity to be added.
Users also have an option to add money to their wallet with password confirmation, and they have a view cart option. Cart shows the total amount of all the cart items, and the amount available in the wallet. They can change or delete the items added in the cart. 

Navigating through multiple pages and executing the functionalities are simple and self explanatory in the app.

Have fun exploring!

Thank You.
